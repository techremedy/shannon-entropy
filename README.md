# shannon-entropy

This is starting out as a simple php app that takes some input and determines the Shannon Entropy of that string of text. Shannon Entropy is very interesting and you can read more about it [here](http://www.bearcave.com/misl/misl_tech/wavelets/compression/shannon.html).

This simple app is just a fun project that I hope to eventually improve to be actually useful and helpful in the fields of data compression and encryption.
